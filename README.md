  Hi, I’m @yyhansen。I’m come back on 2021/7/25。
  I'm going to start learning self-discipline. I was busy with work before, so I didn't have time to do coding and reading well. 
I didn't think about what aspects to further study. Of course, I don't have a good idea now, so I plan to spend three months to 
brush up on one hundred LeetCode algorithm problems, during which I will think about my future learning direction, and improve my algorithm coding ability 
and the ability to express, summarize and share.
  You can pay attention to and urge me; let’s learn and make progress together
